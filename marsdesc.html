							Mount Sharp stands about 3 miles (5 kilometers) high in the middle of Gale Crater, which spans 96 miles (154 kilometers) in diameter. Vera Rubin Ridge is on the northwestern flank of lower Mount Sharp. The foreground of this panorama shows portions of lower Mount Sharp. The middle distance shows the floor of Gale Crater.

						<h2 class="hvrbox-title">Lakebed</h2>
							"Hidden Valley," seen from the valley floor.Thick-laminated, evenly-stratified rock type that forms stratigraphically beneath cross-bedded sandstones regarded as ancient river deposits. These rocks are interpreted to record sedimentation in a lake, as part of or in front of a delta, where plumes of river sediment settled out of the water column and onto the lake floor.

						<h2 class="hvrbox-title">Curiosity Clay</h2>
							Mount Sharp stands in the middle of Gale Crater, which is 96 miles (154 kilometers) in diameter. This mound, which Curiosity has been climbing since 2014, likely formed in the presence of water at various points of time in Mars ancient history. That makes it an ideal place to study how water influenced the habitability of Mars billions of years ago.

Removing dust from part of the Christmas Cove target was part of an experiment to check whether dust is subduing the apparent indications of hematite in some of the area's bedrock. The brushed area's purplish tint is characteristic of fine-grained hematite.

							This image from NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) shows an impact crater looking amusingly like a tadpole because of the valley that was carved by water that used to fill it.It is often difficult to differentiate between inlet and outlet channels, but water always flows downhill. In this particular case, we can infer that water is flowing outward because we have the necessary terrain-height information.

						<h2 class="hvrbox-title">ESA</h2>
						This first mission of ESA's ExoMars program consists of a Trace Gas Orbiter plus an Entry, descent and landing Demonstrator Module, known as Schiaparelli (which transmitted data during its descent before crash landing on the martian surface). The main objectives of this mission are to search for evidence of methane and other trace atmospheric gases..

						<h2 class="hvrbox-title">Maven</h2>
						MAVEN, which stands for Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution mission, has provided first-of-its-kind measurements to address key questions about Mars climate and habitability and improve understanding of dynamic processes in the upper Martian atmosphere and ionosphere.

						<h2 class="hvrbox-title">Odyssey</h2>
						Mars Odyssey is capturing images of the Martian surface at resolutions between those of Viking and Mars Global Surveyor, and is making both daytime and nighttime observations of the surface in thermal infrared wavelengths at resolutions higher than ever before. It has detected massive deposits of water lying below Marsâ€™ surface.

						<h2 class="hvrbox-title">Beagle</h2>
						Beagle 2 may have landed too hard, the victim of an unexpectedly thin atmosphere at the time of its arrival.
						Mars Express successfully entered orbit on December 26 and immediately began returning stunning, 3D, color images. Mars Express has detected surprising concentrations of methane and evidence for recent volcanism on Mars. Its radar sounder, MARSIS, was deployed late in the mission due to spacecraft safety concerns.

						<h2 class="hvrbox-title">Mangalyaan</h2>
						Sometimes referred to by the nickname "Mangalyaan," the Mars Orbiter Mission is India's first interplanetary spacecraft. It is primarily a technology demonstration mission that carries a small, 15-kilogram payload of 5 science instruments. It entered orbit at Mars in September 2014, just two days after the arrival of NASA's MAVEN mission. The orbit is highly elliptical, from 387 to 80,000 kilometers.

						<h2 class="hvrbox-title">Curiosity rover</h2>
						Curiosity is the next generation of rover, building on the successes of Spirit and Opportunity. It landed in Gale Crater, the location of a 5+ km tall mound of layered sedimentary material, which Curiosity has found was at least partially deposited in a lake setting. The rover has also made key discoveries such as the detection of organic material.

						<h2 class="hvrbox-title">Mars Express</h2>
						Mars Express, a lander designed to perform exobiology and geochemistry research. The orbiter has been successfully performing scientific measurements since early 2004, namely, high-resolution imaging and mineralogical mapping of the surface, radar sounding of the subsurface structure down to the permafrost, precise determination of the atmospheric circulation.

			<h3>Atmosphere : Whats above the sky</h3>

			<div class="hvrbox">

				<div class="hvrbox-layer_top">
					<div class="hvrbox-text" style="font-size:15px;">
						<h2 class="hvrbox-title">Sunset</h2>
						 in the Martian atmosphere has fine particles that permit blue light to penetrate the atmosphere more efficiently than longer-wavelength colors. That causes the blue colors in the mixed light coming from the sun to stay closer to sun's part of the sky, compared to the wider scattering of yellow and red colors. The effect is most pronounced near sunset, when light from the sun passes through a longer path in the atmosphere than it does at mid-day.

					<div class="hvrbox-text" style="font-size:15px;">
						<h2 class="hvrbox-title">Red planet</h2>
							The atmosphere of Mars is less than 1% of Earthâ€™s, so it does not protect the planet from the Sunâ€™s radiation nor does it do much to retain heat at the surface. It consists of 95% carbon dioxide, 3% nitrogen, 1.6% argon, and the remainder is trace amounts of oxygen, water vapor, and other gases. Also, it is constantly filled with small particles of dust(mainly iron oxide), which give Mars its reddish hue.

				<div class="hvrbox-layer_top">
					<div class="hvrbox-text" style="font-size:15px;">
						<h2 class="hvrbox-title">Clouds</h2>
							As water ice clouds cover the sky, the sky takes on a more bluish cast. This is because small particles (perhaps a tenth the size of the Martian dust, or one-thousandth the thickness of a human hair) are bright in blue light, but almost invisible in red light. Thus, scientists expect that the ice particles in the clouds are very small. The clouds were imaged by the Imager for Mars Pathfinder (IMP).

			<h2>About</h2>
			<p>
				Space Organization of India is the space agency of the Government of India headquartered in the city of Pune. Its vision is to "harness space technology for national development while pursuing space science research and planetary exploration."

				Formed in 1969, SOI superseded the erstwhile Indian National Committee for Space Research (INCOSPAR) established in 1962 by the efforts of independent India's first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, and his close aide and scientist Vikram Sarabhai. The establishment of SOI thus institutionalized space activities in India. It is managed by the Department of Space, which reports to the Prime Minister of India.
